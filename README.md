# LINT-FS üìê
Lint Your File System with Regular Expressions!

## Why?
We have got linters and static analyzers. But the stated structure of your project plays an equally important role in keeping your code clean.
**So welcome the automated tool for linting the filesystem of your projects!** ‚úåÔ∏è

## How?
1. Install
```
\\ locally
npm install --save-dev lint-fs

\\ globally
npm install -g lint-fs
```
2. Configure

Configure the [`lint-fs.yaml`](lint-fs.yaml) file in your project's root and specify your project's structure using the power of [ECMAScript Regular Expressions](https://regex101.com/) for rules!

3. Run
```
\\ locally
npx lint-fs

\\ globally
lint-fs
```
