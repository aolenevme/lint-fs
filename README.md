Lint your filesystem with regular expressions!

```
\\ locally
npm install --save-dev lint-fs

\\ globally

2. Configure
Create the [`lint-fs.yaml`](lint-fs.yaml.example) file in the root of your project and specify the structure of your project using the power of [ECMAScript Regular Expressions](https://regex101.com/) for rules!

3. Run
